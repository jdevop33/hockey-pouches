# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary

The deployment was failing with the following error:

```
Error occurred prerendering page "/login". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/prerender-error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.
```

This typically happens when there's an issue with component imports or when a component is incorrectly rendered.

## Solutions Applied

1. **Fixed Import Path in CsrfToken Component**:

   - Changed import from `@/lib/csrf-client` to `../lib/csrf-client`
   - Removed unused `CsrfTokenType` import

2. **Configured Husky to Skip in Vercel Environment**:

   - Added `"HUSKY": "0"` to the environment variables in `vercel.json`
   - This prevents Husky's git hooks installation from failing in the non-git Vercel environment

3. **Cache Tags Issues**:

   - Verified there are no issues with `unstable_cache` tags in the codebase
   - No changes were needed as the scripts reported no issues

4. **Created Import Path Fix Script**:

   - Created a new script (`scripts/fix-import-paths.mjs`) that converts `@/` imports in client components to relative paths
   - This prevents potential issues with component resolution during static generation
   - Run this script before deployment to catch any problematic imports

5. **Created Deployment Preparation Scripts**:

   - `prepare-vercel-build.mjs`: Runs all fix scripts before the build
   - `test-deployment.mjs`: Tests the deployment locally before pushing to Vercel
   - Updated package.json with new scripts for easier use:
     - `npm run fix:client-imports`: Fixes client component imports
     - `npm run prepare-vercel`: Runs all fix scripts
     - `npm run test:deployment`: Tests the build process
     - `npm run build:vercel`: Custom build command for Vercel

6. **Updated Vercel Configuration**:
   - Set `buildCommand` in vercel.json to use our custom build command
   - This ensures all fix scripts run before the build on Vercel

## Complete Solution Implementation

The comprehensive solution involved:

1. Fixing the immediate issue with CsrfToken component imports
2. Creating automation to prevent similar issues in the future
3. Setting up proper Vercel configuration for reliable deployments
4. Adding tools to test deployments locally before pushing to production

## For Future Reference

When deploying to Vercel, consider the following:

1. Always use relative imports (`../path`) instead of absolute imports with `@/` in client components
2. Disable Husky during CI/CD to prevent issues with git hooks in non-git environments
3. When you see "Element type is invalid" errors, check your component imports and usage
4. Test builds locally before deploying to catch these issues earlier

## Local Testing Before Deployment

Use the following command to test your build locally before deploying:

```bash
# Run the deployment test script
npm run test:deployment

# Or run individual steps manually:
# Fix potential issues
npm run fix:all

# Run the build
next build
```

This should catch many of the issues that might arise during deployment.
