# Vercel Deployment Fix

This file was created to help fix the Vercel deployment issue.

The issue was that the deployment was using an older commit (b68d306) which still had the dynamic imports with `ssr: false` in the server component.

We've fixed this by:

1. Moving all analytics scripts to the head section using Next.js's Script component
2. Using the suppressHydrationWarning attribute on the body tag
3. Removing all dynamic imports with ssr: false
4. Creating a new branch and merging it to trigger a new deployment

This should resolve the deployment issue.

## April 2025 Deployment Strategy

After evaluating options, we decided to:

1. Continue using React 19.1.0 for our application
2. Implement our own custom solution rather than adopting Medusa.js
3. Fix compatibility issues through custom implementation
4. Fixed linter warning in WholesaleApplicationForm.tsx for unused catch variable

The previous attempt to downgrade React to 18.2.0 for Medusa.js compatibility was reverted in favor of continuing with our custom implementation.
