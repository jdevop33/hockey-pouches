## Architecture Documentation

### Service-Based Architecture

We've implemented a service-based architecture to replace the Medusa.js dependency:

1. **ProductService** - Handles all product-related operations:

   - Product retrieval with variations
   - Product creation and updates
   - Wholesale order validation

2. **CommissionService** - Manages commission-related functionality:

   - Calculates referral commissions
   - Processes distributor fulfillment commissions
   - Handles commission payouts
   - Provides commission statistics

3. **WholesaleService** - Manages wholesale buyer functionality:
   - Application processing
   - Minimum order requirements validation
   - Wholesale-specific pricing

### Database Schema Updates

We've added several new tables to support our custom implementation:

1. **wholesale_applications** - Stores wholesale buyer applications
2. **payouts** - Tracks commission payout batches
3. **notifications** - System notifications for users

### API Endpoints

1. **Product Endpoints**

   - `GET /api/products` - List products with filtering and pagination
   - `GET /api/products/[productId]` - Get a specific product with variations

2. **Wholesale Endpoints**

   - `POST /api/wholesale/apply` - Submit wholesale application
   - `PATCH /api/admin/wholesale/applications/[customerId]` - Approve/reject applications

3. **Commission Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/orders/[orderId]/calculate-commission` - Calculate commission for order
   - `POST /api/admin/commissions/payout` - Process commission payouts

## Next Steps

1. Complete mobile optimization
2. Finish dark mode implementation for all pages
3. Implement performance optimizations
4. Run final testing
5. Deploy to production environment
