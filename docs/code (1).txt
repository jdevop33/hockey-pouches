## 1. Reciprocation

*   **Core Concept:** People feel indebted and obliged to repay favors, gifts, or concessions, even unsolicited ones.
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Offer Value First:** Provide free, valuable content (guides, checklists, tools), samples, trials, consultations, or discounts *before* asking for a sale or commitment.
    *   **Frame as a Gift:** Position offers not just as marketing but as genuine gifts or acts of goodwill ("A complimentary gift for our valued readers...").
    *   **Concessions (Rejection-then-Retreat):** Start with a larger request likely to be refused, then "retreat" to the smaller, actual request. The second request is perceived as a concession, making the prospect more likely to reciprocate with agreement. (e.g., Offer premium package first, then standard after refusal).
    *   **Language:** Use terms implying debt or generosity ("much obliged," "return the favor," "our treat," "complimentary").

## 2. Commitment and Consistency

*   **Core Concept:** People have a deep desire to be (and appear) consistent with what they have already done or said. Once a commitment is made (especially publicly or actively), people stick to it.
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Start Small (Foot-in-the-Door):** Ask for small, easy commitments first (e.g., answer a simple poll, sign up for a newsletter, download a freebie, agree with a value statement) before asking for larger commitments (purchase, major subscription).
    *   **Active Commitments:** Encourage active participation â€“ filling out forms, checking boxes, writing testimonials/reviews, participating in contests (even if small). Written commitments are stronger.
    *   **Public Commitments:** Encourage sharing commitments or purchases publicly (social media shares, public reviews, user forums). People strive to maintain a consistent public persona.
    *   **Align with Self-Image:** Frame requests in ways that align with the target audience's existing values or stated self-image (e.g., "As a smart investor...", "For environmentally conscious homeowners like you..."). Get them to *state* they possess a certain trait you want to leverage.
    *   **Low-Ball Technique:** Secure agreement with an initial good offer, then remove some benefits or add costs *after* the commitment is made. People often stick to the decision because they've already internally justified it (Use ethically!).

## 3. Social Proof

*   **Core Concept:** People determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct, especially when uncertain or when observing people similar to themselves. "Truths are Us."
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Testimonials & Reviews:** Feature positive reviews, ratings, and detailed testimonials from satisfied customers. Video testimonials are powerful.
    *   **Highlight Similarity:** Use testimonials from people the target audience identifies with (same demographics, profession, problems).
    *   **Show Numbers:** Mention user counts ("Join 10,000 happy customers"), subscriber numbers, download stats, social shares.
    *   **Best-Sellers/Most Popular:** Label products or options as "most popular," "best-selling," or "customer favorite."
    *   **Expert/Celebrity Endorsements:** Show endorsements from respected figures (overlaps with Authority) or well-liked celebrities (overlaps with Liking).
    *   **Case Studies:** Provide detailed stories of how others successfully used the product/service.
    *   **"Wisdom of Crowds":** Imply that the sheer number of people choosing an option indicates its correctness.

## 4. Liking

*   **Core Concept:** People prefer to say yes to individuals they know and like.
*   **Factors Increasing Liking:**
    *   **Physical Attractiveness:** Use attractive models/spokespeople (halo effect).
    *   **Similarity:** We like people similar to us (opinions, personality, background, lifestyle, dress, values).
    *   **Compliments:** We tend to believe praise and like those who provide it, even if it's inaccurate.
    *   **Contact & Cooperation:** Familiarity through repeated contact (under positive circumstances) increases liking. Working together towards common goals builds rapport.
    *   **Conditioning & Association:** We like things associated with positive experiences or people.
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Build Rapport:** Use a friendly, conversational, and relatable brand voice. Tell stories.
    *   **Emphasize Similarity:** "We're just like you," "We understand your challenges," highlight shared values or backgrounds.
    *   **Use Compliments:** Flatter the audience subtly ("For discerning homeowners like you...").
    *   **Associate with Positivity:** Link the brand/product to liked celebrities, attractive visuals, positive emotions, popular causes, or successful outcomes. Avoid negative associations.
    *   **"About Us" Story:** Humanize the brand with a compelling origin story or team introduction.
    *   **Referral Programs:** Leverage existing friendships ("Recommended by your friend [Name]...").

## 5. Authority

*   **Core Concept:** People have a deep-seated sense of duty to authority and are highly likely to follow the lead of credible, knowledgeable experts (or symbols of authority).
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Cite Experts:** Quote or feature endorsements from recognized experts, doctors, scientists, industry leaders.
    *   **Show Credentials:** Display titles (Dr., Ph.D., CEO), certifications, awards, affiliations with reputable institutions.
    *   **Use Symbols:** Leverage symbols of authority like uniforms, lab coats, official-looking documents, professional titles, or prestigious affiliations in visuals or copy.
    *   **Authoritative Tone/Design:** Present information confidently and professionally. Use design elements that convey expertise and trustworthiness.
    *   **Demonstrate Expertise:** Provide genuinely useful, expert-level information or content that establishes the brand as an authority in its field.

## 6. Scarcity

*   **Core Concept:** Opportunities seem more valuable when their availability is limited. People are more motivated by the thought of losing something than gaining something of equal value (loss aversion). Psychological reactance makes restricted items more desirable.
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Limited Number:** "Only 50 spots available," "Just 3 left in stock."
    *   **Limited Time (Deadline):** "Offer ends Friday," "Sale lasts 24 hours," "Last chance."
    *   **Exclusive Information:** Position information or offers as scarce or exclusive ("Insider tips," "Not available elsewhere," "Exclusive access for members").
    *   **Highlight Potential Loss:** Frame benefits in terms of what the customer stands to *lose* if they don't act ("Don't miss out on...", "Avoid the frustration of...").
    *   **Competition:** Imply or state that others are also interested in the scarce item ("Selling fast," "Popular demand").
    *   **Newly Scarce > Always Scarce:** Emphasize if something has *just* become scarce or if a deadline is approaching (increases urgency more than long-term scarcity).

**Key Takeaway:** These principles are powerful shortcuts people use for decision-making. Understanding them allows for more effective communication. Use ethically to provide genuine value and guide choices, not manipulate. Combining principles often amplifies the effect.
