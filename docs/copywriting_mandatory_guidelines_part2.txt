# Copywriting Notes Set 1: Crafting Effective Prose (from Sin and Syntax)

**Source:** Sin and Syntax: How to Craft Wickedly Effective Prose by Constance Hale

**Core Philosophy:** Effective writing balances understanding grammatical rules ("Syntax") with the creative, artful breaking of those rules ("Sin"). It's about precision *and* playfulness, clarity *and* music.

---

## I. Principles of Word Choice ("Relish Every Word")

*   **Precision is Key:** Choose words that *exactly* express your meaning. Understand denotation (literal meaning) and connotation (suggested meaning).
    *   *Example:* `Peach` vs. `Mango` – similar denotation, different connotations.
*   **Concrete & Specific > Abstract & General:** Prefer tangible words over vague concepts.
    *   *Example:* `Kiss` > `Demonstration of affection`; `Bungalow` > `Dwelling`.
*   **Strong Nouns:** Build descriptions around powerful, specific nouns rather than relying on adjectives. Use nouns that evoke senses and emotions.
    *   *Example (Timerman):* Using `cell`, `floor`, `mattress`, `Rolex watches` paints a stark, specific picture.
    *   *Example (Warhol):* Using `languor`, `pallor`, `freakiness`, `tropisms` creates an abstract, intangible feel.
*   **Sensuousness:** Pay attention to the sound, cadence, and spirit of words. Let them play off each other.
*   **Avoid Noun Clunkers:** Don't create awkward nouns by slapping prefixes/suffixes together (e.g., `izationization`, `effectualization`).
*   **Embrace Rich Vocabulary:** Don't shy away from less common but precise words if they fit. Avoid the "lowest common denominator."
*   **Brand Names as Nouns:** Effective brand names become evocative nouns synonymous with the product (e.g., `Coca-Cola`, `Tide`, `PowerBook`).

---

## II. Principles of Verb Use ("Make Verbs Quiver")

*   **Dynamic Verbs > Static Verbs:** Prefer action verbs over forms of "to be" (`is`, `are`, `was`, `were`) or other linking verbs (`seem`, `appear`, `become`). Strong verbs energize prose.
    *   *Action:* Circle every form of 'to be' in drafts and try to replace them.
*   **Active Voice > Passive Voice:** Generally prefer active voice (subject performs the action) for directness and clarity.
    *   *Active:* "We end the heartache."
    *   *Passive:* "The heartache is ended by us." (Weaker)
    *   **Exception:** Use passive intentionally to emphasize the recipient of the action or obscure the agent (e.g., "Mistakes were made").
*   **Strong Verb Choice:** Don't settle for weak/generic verbs. Be inventive.
    *   *Example:* `Paces`, `skips`, `skedaddles` > `walks`; `Wail`, `whisper`, `insist` > `says`.
*   **Avoid Weak/Empty Verbs:** Watch out for verbs that add little action (e.g., `has`, `get`, `go`, `put`, `does`, `seems`, `appears`). Replace phrases built around them with a single strong verb.
    *   *Example:* `He has a plan to` -> `He plans to`.
*   **Beware Verbifying Nouns:** While sometimes effective (`stonewall`, `launder`), often creates awkward jargon (`feedback`, `context`, `caveat`, `impact`, `interface`, `prioritize`).

---

## III. Principles of Sentence Structure ("Unify Elements into a Strong Stream")

*   **Subject-Predicate Core:** Every sentence needs a clear subject (who/what) and predicate (does/is what). Keep this core strong.
*   **Sentence Variety:** Mix simple, compound, and complex sentences. Vary length and rhythm. Avoid relentless short, choppy sentences (Dick-and-Jane style) *unless* for specific effect.
    *   **Simple:** One subject-predicate pair. Powerful for punch.
    *   **Compound:** Two+ independent clauses linked (e.g., by FANBOYS conjunctions, semicolon). Balances ideas.
    *   **Complex:** One independent clause + one or more dependent clauses. Shows relationships (cause/effect, condition).
*   **Parallelism:** Use similar grammatical structure for elements in a list or series. Creates rhythm, clarity, and elegance. Essential for complex sentences with multiple phrases/clauses.
    *   *Example (JFK):* "born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by..."
*   **Avoid Fragments (Usually):** Ensure sentences have a subject and verb. Use fragments *intentionally* and sparingly for stylistic effect (e.g., emphasis, poetic feel, mimicking thought).
*   **Clear Connections:** Use conjunctions (coordinate, subordinate, correlative) and conjunctive adverbs effectively to link ideas smoothly and show relationships. Avoid overuse of `but`, `yet`, `however`.
*   **Avoid Run-ons & Rambling:** Don't string too many ideas together without clear structure or punctuation. Long sentences need careful calibration (like McCarthy) or risk becoming Towers of Babble.

## IV. Principles of Style & Music ("Seek Beauty, Find Pitch, Take Risks")

*   **Simplicity & Depth:** Aim for clarity but don't sacrifice richness or complexity of thought. Avoid jargon, bureaucratese, and empty abstractions. Cut unnecessary words. ("Be Simple, But Go Deep")
*   **Audience Awareness (Pitch):** Write *to* your reader. Avoid pretension and inappropriate jargon. Strive for a tone that is authentic and appropriate for the context. ("Find the Right Pitch")
*   **Take Risks:** Don't cling to "safe" or standard language. Explore slang, vernacular, neologisms, and vivid metaphors if they serve the purpose. Avoid clichés. ("Take Risks")
*   **Musicality (Beauty):** Read your writing aloud. Listen for rhythm, cadence, assonance, consonance, alliteration. How do the words *sound* together? ("Seek Beauty")
*   **Voice:** Develop a distinctive, authentic voice. It can be conversational, formal, technical, poetic, etc., but it should be consistent and appropriate. Learn from different styles (journalism, fiction, speeches, email).
*   **Show, Don't Tell:** Use concrete details, strong verbs, specific nouns, and evocative imagery/metaphor instead of relying on generic, emotional adjectives (`interesting`, `unique`, `good`, `bad`). Let the reader *feel* the conclusion.

---

## Cardinal Sins to Avoid:

*   **Sloth:** Using clichés, shopworn phrases, `-ization` nouns. Failing to find the *right* word.
*   **Gluttony:** Using five words where one will do; excessive abstraction.
*   **Fog:** Vague, woolly words; piling up abstract nouns.
*   **Pretense:** Pompous, academic, or overly formal language that obscures meaning or distances the reader.
*   **Gobbledygook/Jargon:** Using technical terms or bureaucratese inappropriately for the audience.
*   **Euphemism:** Using mild words to describe harsh realities; concealing meaning.
*   **Grammar Errors:** Pronoun agreement (`their` for singular), pronoun case (`between you and I`), dangling modifiers, unclear antecedents, subject-verb disagreement, confusing `like`/`as`.
*   **Weak Verbs/Passive Voice:** Over-reliance on "to be" and passive constructions.
*   **Sentence Errors:** Fragments (unintentional), run-ons, lack of parallelism, drifting subjects/predicates.
*   **Dead Metaphors/Clichés:** Using tired figures of speech.
*   **Mixed Metaphors:** Confusing figurative comparisons.
*   **Writing Off Key/Phoney Tones:** Using the wrong voice or tone for the audience/occasion.

---

**Key Takeaway:** Master the rules of grammar and syntax not just to be "correct," but to gain the power and flexibility to express ideas with clarity, force, beauty, and originality—even (and especially) when you choose to break those rules artfully.

# Copywriting Notes Set 2: Principles of Influence (from Influence)

**Source:** Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert B. Cialdini, Ph.D.

**Purpose:** To leverage fundamental psychological principles in brand development and copywriting to ethically increase persuasion and conversion.

---

## 1. Reciprocation

*   **Core Concept:** People feel indebted and obliged to repay favors, gifts, or concessions, even unsolicited ones.
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Offer Value First:** Provide free, valuable content (guides, checklists, tools), samples, trials, consultations, or discounts *before* asking for a sale or commitment.
    *   **Frame as a Gift:** Position offers not just as marketing but as genuine gifts or acts of goodwill ("A complimentary gift for our valued readers...").
    *   **Concessions (Rejection-then-Retreat):** Start with a larger request likely to be refused, then "retreat" to the smaller, actual request. The second request is perceived as a concession, making the prospect more likely to reciprocate with agreement. (e.g., Offer premium package first, then standard after refusal).
    *   **Language:** Use terms implying debt or generosity ("much obliged," "return the favor," "our treat," "complimentary").

---

## 2. Commitment and Consistency

*   **Core Concept:** People have a deep desire to be (and appear) consistent with what they have already done or said. Once a commitment is made (especially publicly or actively), people stick to it.
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Start Small (Foot-in-the-Door):** Ask for small, easy commitments first (e.g., answer a simple poll, sign up for a newsletter, download a freebie, agree with a value statement) before asking for larger commitments (purchase, major subscription).
    *   **Active Commitments:** Encourage active participation – filling out forms, checking boxes, writing testimonials/reviews, participating in contests (even if small). Written commitments are stronger.
    *   **Public Commitments:** Encourage sharing commitments or purchases publicly (social media shares, public reviews, user forums). People strive to maintain a consistent public persona.
    *   **Align with Self-Image:** Frame requests in ways that align with the target audience's existing values or stated self-image (e.g., "As a smart investor...", "For environmentally conscious homeowners like you..."). Get them to *state* they possess a certain trait you want to leverage.
    *   **Low-Ball Technique:** Secure agreement with an initial good offer, then remove some benefits or add costs *after* the commitment is made. People often stick to the decision because they've already internally justified it (Use ethically!).

---

## 3. Social Proof

*   **Core Concept:** People determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct, especially when uncertain or when observing people similar to themselves. "Truths are Us."
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Testimonials & Reviews:** Feature positive reviews, ratings, and detailed testimonials from satisfied customers. Video testimonials are powerful.
    *   **Highlight Similarity:** Use testimonials from people the target audience identifies with (same demographics, profession, problems).
    *   **Show Numbers:** Mention user counts ("Join 10,000 happy customers"), subscriber numbers, download stats, social shares.
    *   **Best-Sellers/Most Popular:** Label products or options as "most popular," "best-selling," or "customer favorite."
    *   **Expert/Celebrity Endorsements:** Show endorsements from respected figures (overlaps with Authority) or well-liked celebrities (overlaps with Liking).
    *   **Case Studies:** Provide detailed stories of how others successfully used the product/service.
    *   **"Wisdom of Crowds":** Imply that the sheer number of people choosing an option indicates its correctness.

---

## 4. Liking

*   **Core Concept:** People prefer to say yes to individuals they know and like.
*   **Factors Increasing Liking:**
    *   **Physical Attractiveness:** Use attractive models/spokespeople (halo effect).
    *   **Similarity:** We like people similar to us (opinions, personality, background, lifestyle, dress, values).
    *   **Compliments:** We tend to believe praise and like those who provide it, even if it's inaccurate.
    *   **Contact & Cooperation:** Familiarity through repeated contact (under positive circumstances) increases liking. Working together towards common goals builds rapport.
    *   **Conditioning & Association:** We like things associated with positive experiences or people.
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Build Rapport:** Use a friendly, conversational, and relatable brand voice. Tell stories.
    *   **Emphasize Similarity:** "We're just like you," "We understand your challenges," highlight shared values or backgrounds.
    *   **Use Compliments:** Flatter the audience subtly ("For discerning homeowners like you...").
    *   **Associate with Positivity:** Link the brand/product to liked celebrities, attractive visuals, positive emotions, popular causes, or successful outcomes. Avoid negative associations.
    *   **"About Us" Story:** Humanize the brand with a compelling origin story or team introduction.
    *   **Referral Programs:** Leverage existing friendships ("Recommended by your friend [Name]...").

---

## 5. Authority

*   **Core Concept:** People have a deep-seated sense of duty to authority and are highly likely to follow the lead of credible, knowledgeable experts (or symbols of authority).
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Cite Experts:** Quote or feature endorsements from recognized experts, doctors, scientists, industry leaders.
    *   **Show Credentials:** Display titles (Dr., Ph.D., CEO), certifications, awards, affiliations with reputable institutions.
    *   **Use Symbols:** Leverage symbols of authority like uniforms, lab coats, official-looking documents, professional titles, or prestigious affiliations in visuals or copy.
    *   **Authoritative Tone/Design:** Present information confidently and professionally. Use design elements that convey expertise and trustworthiness.
    *   **Demonstrate Expertise:** Provide genuinely useful, expert-level information or content that establishes the brand as an authority in its field.

---

## 6. Scarcity

*   **Core Concept:** Opportunities seem more valuable when their availability is limited. People are more motivated by the thought of losing something than gaining something of equal value (loss aversion). Psychological reactance makes restricted items more desirable.
*   **Copywriting Applications:**
    *   **Limited Number:** "Only 50 spots available," "Just 3 left in stock."
    *   **Limited Time (Deadline):** "Offer ends Friday," "Sale lasts 24 hours," "Last chance."
    *   **Exclusive Information:** Position information or offers as scarce or exclusive ("Insider tips," "Not available elsewhere," "Exclusive access for members").
    *   **Highlight Potential Loss:** Frame benefits in terms of what the customer stands to *lose* if they don't act ("Don't miss out on...", "Avoid the frustration of...").
    *   **Competition:** Imply or state that others are also interested in the scarce item ("Selling fast," "Popular demand").
    *   **Newly Scarce > Always Scarce:** Emphasize if something has *just* become scarce or if a deadline is approaching (increases urgency more than long-term scarcity).

**Note on Integration:** *Influence* provides the *psychological framework* for persuasion (the 'Why'). *Sin and Syntax* provides the *linguistic tools* for crafting the message effectively (the 'How'). Use Cialdini's principles to structure your persuasive *strategy* and Hale's principles to execute the *expression* with clarity, power, and style.
