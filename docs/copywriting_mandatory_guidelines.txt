# Integrated Copywriting Notes: Applying Craft (Sin & Syntax) to Persuasion (Influence)

**Objective:** Use the stylistic and grammatical tools from *Sin and Syntax* to effectively and ethically implement the psychological principles of persuasion from *Influence*.

---

## Principle 1: Reciprocation (Cialdini) + Craft (Hale)

*   **Goal:** Make the reader feel obliged to reciprocate after receiving value.
*   **Sin & Syntax Applications:**
    *   **Words (Relish Every Word):** Use warm, generous language for the initial offer ("complimentary," "our gift to you," "free access," "valuable resource"). Choose precise nouns/verbs to describe the value *given* (e.g., not just "free info" but "a detailed checklist," "an insightful guide").
    *   **Sentences (Simple but Deep; Variety):** Describe the free offer clearly and simply. When making the subsequent request (the ask), use clear, direct sentences (S+V or S+V+DO). If using Rejection-then-Retreat, ensure the contrast between the large and small request is stark and easy to grasp.
    *   **Music (Pitch, Voice):** Adopt a generous, helpful, non-demanding tone for the initial offer. Shift slightly to a clear, simple request tone for the ask. Avoid jargon or overly complex sentences that obscure the value offered or the request made.

## Principle 2: Commitment & Consistency (Cialdini) + Craft (Hale)

*   **Goal:** Get small initial commitments and align subsequent requests with the reader's desire to be consistent.
*   **Sin & Syntax Applications:**
    *   **Words (Relish Every Word; Simple):** Use action-oriented verbs for the initial small commitment ("Click," "Download," "Sign up," "Share," "Agree"). Use identity-related nouns/adjectives when framing requests ("As a smart homeowner...," "Join fellow innovators...").
    *   **Sentences (Simple; Variety):** Make the initial commitment request incredibly simple and clear (S+V+DO). Structure questions that elicit "yes" answers aligning with the desired self-image ("Do you believe in protecting the environment? Then you'll appreciate..."). Use clear, declarative sentences for subsequent requests that logically follow the initial commitment.
    *   **Music (Voice, Pitch):** Start with an engaging, easy-to-agree-with tone. Reinforce consistency with a confident, affirming tone ("Since you value X, you'll love Y...").

## Principle 3: Social Proof (Cialdini) + Craft (Hale)

*   **Goal:** Show that others (especially similar others) approve of or use the product/service.
*   **Sin & Syntax Applications:**
    *   **Words (Relish Every Word; Concrete):** Use strong, specific nouns and verbs in testimonials ("slashed my workload," "crystal-clear results," not just "good product"). Quote exact numbers ("10,572 satisfied users"). Use concrete nouns to describe *who* the others are (e.g., "fellow dentists," "busy moms," "savvy investors").
    *   **Sentences (Simple; Variety):** Present testimonials as direct quotes in simple, authentic-sounding sentences. Use clear, concise sentences to state numbers or popularity ("#1 Best-Seller," "Most Popular Choice"). Structure sentences to highlight similarity ("Like you, Sarah was struggling with...").
    *   **Music (Voice, Pitch):** Let the authentic voices of customers come through in testimonials. Use a confident, matter-of-fact tone when presenting statistics or popularity claims. Avoid overly slick or generic language that undermines authenticity.

## Principle 4: Liking (Cialdini) + Craft (Hale)

*   **Goal:** Build rapport and make the reader feel positive towards the brand/messenger.
*   **Sin & Syntax Applications:**
    *   **Words (Relish Every Word; Seek Beauty):** Use warm, positive, friendly words. Choose specific, evocative nouns/adjectives that resonate with the target audience's interests or background (demonstrating similarity). Use compliments genuinely.
    *   **Sentences (Variety; Simple but Deep):** Vary sentence structure to sound conversational and engaging, not robotic. Use simple sentences for warmth and directness. Employ richer sentences for storytelling (e.g., in the "About Us" section).
    *   **Music (Voice, Pitch; Relish Words):** Develop a distinct, likeable brand voice (humorous, helpful, empathetic, sophisticated?). Ensure the tone is appropriate and authentic. Pay attention to the rhythm and flow – make it pleasant to read. Avoid pretension or jargon that alienates.

---

## Principle 5: Authority (Cialdini) + Craft (Hale)

*   **Goal:** Convey expertise and credibility.
*   **Sin & Syntax Applications:**
    *   **Words (Precise; Standard):** Use precise, clear language appropriate to the field of expertise, but avoid unnecessary jargon when speaking to a lay audience. Use strong nouns and verbs that convey confidence. Clearly state titles and credentials.
    *   **Sentences (Declarative; Structured):** Use clear, direct, declarative sentences. Structure arguments logically. Ensure subject-verb agreement and clear pronoun references to maintain credibility. Avoid fragments or overly casual syntax unless the "authority" persona specifically calls for it.
    *   **Music (Voice, Pitch):** Adopt a confident, knowledgeable, and trustworthy tone. Avoid overly emotional language; let the facts and credentials speak. Ensure prose is clean and error-free – sloppiness undermines authority.

## Principle 6: Scarcity (Cialdini) + Craft (Hale)

*   **Goal:** Highlight limited availability or potential loss to increase perceived value and urgency.
*   **Sin & Syntax Applications:**
    *   **Words (Strong Verbs/Nouns):** Use words that emphasize limits ("exclusive," "limited," "rare," "final," "deadline," "expires," "only"). Use strong verbs for the call to action ("Grab," "Claim," "Secure"). Frame benefits using loss language ("Don't miss out," "Avoid losing").
    *   **Sentences (Short; Imperative):** Use short, punchy sentences to create urgency. Employ the imperative mood ("Act now," "Get yours before it's gone"). Clearly state the terms of the scarcity (the date, the number left).
    *   **Music (Rhythm, Voice):** Use rhythm to build excitement or tension (e.g., quickening pace towards the deadline). Adopt an urgent but clear tone. Avoid overly complex sentences that slow the reader down when urgency is needed.
