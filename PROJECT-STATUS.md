## Technology Stack Best Practices

Following best practices from technology providers:

### Next.js

- Use React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Implement proper data fetching with SWR/TanStack Query
- Utilize Next.js App Router for routing
- Follow Server Actions patterns for server-side mutations

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper state management
- Follow component composition patterns
- Use React Context wisely for global state

### TypeScript

- Ensure strict type safety throughout the application
- Use interfaces for object structure
- Implement proper error handling with typed errors
- Avoid use of 'any' type

### Database

- Use proper indexing for performance
- Implement transactions for critical operations
- Follow normalization principles
- Use prepared statements for queries

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Fix TypeScript errors in API routes
2. Complete user profile management
3. Finish checkout process implementation
4. Implement admin approval workflows
5. Develop order tracking system
6. Add email notifications
