## Implementation Details

### Store Structure

```typescript
// Base store with common functionality
interface BaseState {
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  // ... other common state
}

// UI Store for theme and notifications
interface UIState extends BaseState {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  notifications: Notification[];
  // ... UI actions
}

// Cart Store for shopping functionality
interface CartState extends BaseState {
  items: CartItem[];
  total: number;
  // ... cart actions
}

// Product Store for catalog management
interface ProductState extends BaseState {
  products: Product[];
  filters: ProductFilters;
  // ... product actions
}

interface AuthState extends BaseState {
  user: User | null;
  tokens: Tokens;
  // ... auth actions
}
```
