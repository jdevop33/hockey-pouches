# Project Status Update - August 2023

## Overview

The Hockey Pouches e-commerce application is being refactored to a dark mode only theme. Homepage, About page, Contact page, and Admin Dashboard have been updated to the dark theme. We're continuing to convert all remaining pages to ensure a consistent user experience.

## Current Status

- Dark mode styling has been applied to:
  - Homepage and About page
  - Contact page (fully converted with form styling)
  - Admin Dashboard main page
  - Admin product management pages (listing and details)
  - Admin order management page
  - Admin user management page
  - Admin commission management page
- We've improved TypeScript error handling throughout the app:
  - Converted `any` types to `unknown` with proper type assertions
  - Fixed several TypeScript linting issues in product management
  - Improved error handling patterns across components
- Sentry has been completely removed:
  - Removed the `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file
  - Removed the empty `app/sentry-example-page` directory
  - Confirmed no Sentry imports remain in the codebase
- UI improvements:
  - Added consistent gold accent colors throughout the interface
  - Implemented consistent shadow and border styles with the `shadow-gold-sm` utility
  - Updated form input styling for dark mode compatibility
