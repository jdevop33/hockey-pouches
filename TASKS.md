# Project Status Update - July 2023

## Overview

The Hockey Pouches e-commerce application is being refactored to a dark mode only theme. Homepage and About page are mostly complete, but we need to focus on completing all dashboard interfaces (admin, user profile, etc.).

## Current Status

- Dark mode styling is in progress with the homepage and about page mostly completed
- We've removed Sentry by:
  - Removing the `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file
  - Removing the empty `app/sentry-example-page` directory
  - There were no actual Sentry imports found in the codebase
- There appears to be a persistent linter error with the apple-touch-icon in layout.tsx

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Dark Mode Implementation**
   - Focus on dashboard interfaces first
   - Ensure consistent styling across all components
   - Test on various screen sizes and devices
2. **Dashboard Development**
   - Admin dashboard: Complete all sections (users, orders, products, etc.)
   - User profile dashboard: Implement order history, settings, etc.
   - Distributor dashboard: Finalize commission tracking and order fulfillment
3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement a consistent error handling approach without Sentry
   - Use built-in Next.js error components and API error handling
4. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Ensure all interfaces are fully responsive
   - Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes
5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement image optimization
   - Add proper caching strategies
   - Use React Server Components where appropriate

## Current Observations

- Dark mode styling is in progress and needs to be applied consistently
- The project appears to have Sentry configuration files but minimal actual Sentry integration
- Many dashboard interfaces still need to be completed
- There are some unused files that could be cleaned up

## Immediate Tasks

1. Remove Sentry from the project (as requested)
   - Delete `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file
   - Remove empty `app/sentry-example-page` directory
   - Ensure any instrumentation code doesn't reference Sentry
2. Complete the dark mode refactoring across all interfaces
3. Focus on implementing the remaining dashboard interfaces:
   - Admin dashboard sections
   - User profile dashboards
   - Distributor dashboards
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness across all interfaces
5. Update error handling to use a consistent approach without Sentry
