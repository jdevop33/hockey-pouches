## SQL Migration Guide for Neon PostgreSQL

### Common Issues with Neon SQL Console

When running SQL scripts in the Neon console, comments and multi-statement scripts may cause problems:

1. **Comment Formatting**: Neon's SQL editor sometimes misinterprets certain comment styles
2. **Multiple Statements**: Running multiple statements at once can be problematic
3. **Transaction Management**: Neon may handle transactions differently than expected

### Running SQL Scripts with Neon

#### Method 1: Use the Migration Script (Recommended)

The project includes `scripts/run-migrations.js` which handles migrations properly:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install pg dotenv`
2. Set your DATABASE_URL in `.env.local`:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@your-neon-host/dbname
```

3. Run: `node scripts/run-migrations.js`

This script:

- Automatically tracks applied migrations
- Runs migrations in transaction blocks (rollback on error)
- Handles comments correctly
- Executes migrations in alphabetical order

#### Method 2: Modified SQL in Neon Console

When using Neon's SQL editor directly:

1. **For Comments**:

   - Use `--` single-line comments instead of `/* */` multi-line comments
   - Avoid trailing comments on the same line as SQL statements

2. **Split Complex Scripts**:

   - Run one statement at a time
   - Separate CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, etc. into individual runs

3. **Handling Transactions**:
   - Run BEGIN/COMMIT explicitly for multi-statement operations

#### Method 3: Using psql CLI with Neon

Connect directly with psql using your Neon connection string:

```bash
psql postgresql://user:password@your-neon-host/dbname
```

Then either:

- Run statements interactively
- Execute a script file: `\i path/to/script.sql`

This method handles comments and multi-statements properly.

### Database Schema Validation

After running migrations, verify your schema:

```sql
-- List all tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- View table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'table_name_here';

-- Check indexes
SELECT indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'table_name_here';
```

### Troubleshooting

1. **"Syntax error near..."**: Usually caused by comment format or multiple statements
2. **"Relation already exists"**: Add IF NOT EXISTS to CREATE statements
3. **"Failed to parse query"**: Try running one statement at a time

When all else fails, the migration script in `scripts/run-migrations.js` should work reliably as it handles these edge cases.
