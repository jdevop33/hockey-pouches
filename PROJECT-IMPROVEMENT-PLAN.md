# Project Improvement Plan

## Current Status

- [x] Initial Zustand setup
- [x] Store slices implementation (auth, cart, ui)
- [x] Store middleware setup (logger, devtools, persist)
- [x] Layout improvements and metadata configuration
- [ ] Next.js SSR hydration fixes
- [ ] Dashboard page initialization fixes
- [x] Store circular dependency resolution
- [x] Type safety improvements

## Immediate Tasks

1. Fix store initialization order

   - [x] Create proper store initialization sequence
   - [x] Move store creation to a separate initialization file
   - [x] Implement store provider with proper hydration
     - [x] Basic provider setup
     - [x] Fix store type mismatches with HydratedBaseState
     - [x] Resolve hydration status type issues
     - [x] Test hydration across all stores

2. Fix dashboard page issues

   - [ ] Resolve initialization errors
   - [ ] Implement proper SSR data fetching
   - [ ] Add error boundaries
   - [ ] Improve loading states

3. Improve store architecture

   - [x] Separate store configuration
   - [x] Fix circular dependencies
   - [x] Implement proper type safety
     - [x] Base store types defined
     - [x] Auth store types implemented
     - [x] Fix set function type mismatches
     - [x] Ensure consistent hydration types across stores
   - [ ] Add computed selectors
   - [x] Add middleware for persistence

4. Performance Optimization

   - [ ] Implement code splitting
   - [ ] Add proper caching strategies
   - [ ] Optimize bundle size
   - [ ] Add performance monitoring

5. Testing and Documentation
   - [ ] Add unit tests for store slices
   - [ ] Add integration tests
   - [ ] Add documentation for store usage
   - [ ] Add API documentation

## Long-term Goals

1. Authentication Improvements

   - [ ] Implement refresh token logic
   - [ ] Add session management
   - [ ] Add role-based access control

2. State Management

   - [ ] Add more computed selectors
   - [ ] Implement optimistic updates
   - [ ] Add proper error handling
   - [ ] Add proper loading states

3. UI/UX Improvements

   - [ ] Add more animations
   - [ ] Improve accessibility
   - [ ] Add proper error messages
   - [ ] Add proper loading states

4. Development Experience
   - [ ] Add more TypeScript types
   - [ ] Add proper documentation
   - [ ] Add proper testing
   - [ ] Add proper linting

## Notes

- Need to fix store initialization order to prevent hydration issues
- Currently working on resolving type mismatches between store creator and individual store implementations
- Need to ensure consistent hydration state types across all stores
- Need to fix set function type compatibility in store creators
- Need to improve error handling in store slices
- Need to add proper TypeScript types
- Need to add proper documentation
- Need to add proper testing
