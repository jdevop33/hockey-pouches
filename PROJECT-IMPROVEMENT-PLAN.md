     - [x] Test hydration across all stores

2. Fix dashboard page issues

   - [x] Resolve initialization errors
   - [x] Implement proper SSR data fetching
   - [x] Add error boundaries
   - [x] Improve loading states
   - [x] Add toast notifications
   - [x] Add proper error handling for API calls
   - [x] Convert data fetching to Server Actions
   - [ ] Add retry logic for failed requests
   - [ ] Implement proper data caching

3. Improve store architecture

   - [x] Separate store configuration
   - [x] Fix circular dependencies
   - [x] Implement proper type safety
     - [x] Base store types defined
     - [x] Auth store types implemented
     - [x] Fix set function type mismatches
     - [x] Ensure consistent hydration types across stores
   - [ ] Add computed selectors
   - [x] Add middleware for persistence

4. Performance Optimization

3. UI/UX Improvements

   - [x] Add more animations
   - [x] Improve accessibility
   - [x] Add proper error messages
   - [x] Add proper loading states
   - [x] Implement toast notifications system

4. Development Experience
   - [x] Add more TypeScript types
   - [ ] Add proper documentation
   - [ ] Add proper testing
   - [ ] Add proper linting

## Notes

- Dashboard page has been updated to use server components and proper data fetching
- Added error boundaries for better error handling
- Implemented loading skeletons for better UX
- Added toast notifications for user feedback
- Converted data fetching to Server Actions
- Need to implement proper data caching and retry logic
- Need to add more unit tests and documentation
